# BMW F8X Platform - Crankhub Failure Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the prevalence and patterns of Spun Crank Hub (SCH) failures in BMW vehicles. Using a dataset sourced from a forum thread on the Bimmerpost website, the analysis examines the relationship between SCH failures and various factors such as vehicle models, modifications, and transmission types. The ultimate goal is to provide insights and recommendations to help mitigate SCH issues.

## Project Objectives
* To identify the patterns and trends in SCH failures across different vehicle models and modifications.
* To analyze the impact of modifications and transmission types on the likelihood of SCH failures.
* To provide actionable insights and recommendations for BMW owners and enthusiasts to mitigate the risk of SCH failures.

## Columns:

* Year: The year of the vehicle model.
* Transmission: The type of transmission (e.g., Manual, DCT).
* Modification: The level of modifications done to the vehicle (e.g., Stock, Modified 450-500 whp, etc.).
* SCH_Status: The status of the Spun Crank Hub (e.g., SCH Failure, No SCH).
* Counts: The count of occurrences for each combination of variables.
* Percentage of Whole: The percentage of SCH failures out of the total for each category.

## Usage
This analysis can be used by BMW enthusiasts, mechanics, and potential buyers to understand the risks associated with SCH failures and take preventive measures. The recommendations derived from this analysis can help in reducing the likelihood of SCH failures in BMW vehicles.

## Files Included
* Analysis Script: Python script used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* Data Files: The cleaned dataset used for analysis.
* Final Report: A detailed report summarizing the analysis and findings.
* Presentation Slides: Slides summarizing the key findings and recommendations.
